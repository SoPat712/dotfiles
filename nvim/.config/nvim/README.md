# This is my personal Neovim Configuration

## How it was made

I'll be honest. I liked LazyVim but didn't want to learn the keybinds so I just copied the stuff I needed and added other plugins/changed keybinds for the rest.

## Plugin Manager

[Lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim)
It's not entirely optimized, but I tried to reduce startup time as much as possible

## UI Stuff

I run tokyonight-moon theme, with alpha-nvim as my dashboard.

I also have mini-indentscope and indent-blankline in order to get some cool indentation highlighting. Entirely unnecessary, but entirely cool.

## LSP, Linting, and Formatters.

I switched from null-ls to conform.nvim + nvim-lint after reading a Reddit Post. I find it pretty fast. Still perfecting the configuration though.
