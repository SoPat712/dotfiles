# This will be where I store my dotfiles for preferably the rest of eternity.

I will use GNU Stow to do so, and it's working well enough so far.

## Below is a description for each stow

## NVIM

### How it was made

I'll be honest. I liked LazyVim but didn't want to learn the keybinds so I just copied the stuff I needed and added other plugins/changed keybinds for the rest.

### Plugin Manager

[Lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim)
It's not entirely optimized, but I tried to reduce startup time as much as possible

### UI Stuff

I run tokyonight-moon theme, with alpha-nvim as my dashboard.

I also have mini-indentscope and indent-blankline in order to get some cool indentation highlighting. Entirely unnecessary, but entirely cool.

### LSP, Linting, and Formatters.

I switched from null-ls to conform.nvim + nvim-lint after reading a Reddit Post. I find it pretty fast. Still perfecting the configuration though.

## GIT

Just a .gitconfig built up over regular usage

## TMUX

My new .tmux.conf

## ZSH

Just a basic old ZSH

## QBIT

The WebUI that I use, and the theme that I prefer

## VIM

Hopefully, a portable Vim setup for working over SSH and stuff
